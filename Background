Lovepreet Singh ,
a multi threaded web server handles multiple concurrent web requests at once , of course it will have to be Multi core
processor .


Client Server Connection establishment for data transfer via HTTP  ( DNS domain name resolution  etc) with 3-way TCP handshake - 1. SYN 2. SYN-ACK 3. ACK

http 1.0  vs 1.1 (persistent i.e. connection open till time out.


SOCKET : ip+ port

client 1 Socket --> Server Socket 1
                   socket1 listen()
                   socket2 accept() from Client1

   Any other client puts in request on to server and server is single thread , i.e. it cannot accept or else context switch based on scheduling algo
   but only one at a time.

 if multi threaded
  continued from above

  client 2 , 3 , ... other client request can be handled too by server at same time , thus better efficiency and time

  Drawback
  10,000 rps (requests per second)
  (client count requesting server)

  therefore 10,000 thread blocks will be required/created and this will actively consume humungous amount of compute resource

  solution : Thread pool - limiting thread count and resources
              fixed no. of threads are created and a scheduling for requests with a queue is done . this helps limit simultaneous requests to be handled

              javascript - event loop

              vs thread pool
